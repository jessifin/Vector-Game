Vector-Game
===========

This is the game that I am working on. If you have any questions, shoot me an email at jessifin@gmail.com.

I'm making a third-person adventure game with Vectrex-like graphics. If you don't know what a Vectrex is, it's basically a tiny home arcade that uses Vector graphics (the monitor can only display lines).
I really like the style, and since this is my senior project, it simplifies things to the point where a game is almost managable.
The player will control Arepo, the pilot of a spaceship who crashes into an island on a distant planet. There will be plenty of wacky and diverse fauna (tame and hostile) that the player can interact with.
The goal of the game will be survive long enough to find parts needed to rebuild the spaceship (no, it's not an E.T. ripoff).
This should be a fun project for me that I can use in demonstrations of my javabilities.

I do not own LWJGL or JBullet (ports of OpenGL and the Bullet Physics library, respectively).
